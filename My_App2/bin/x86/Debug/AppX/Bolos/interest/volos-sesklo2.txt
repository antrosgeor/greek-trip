Sesklo

Within 15 km. from Volos, near the present village Sesklo are the remains 
of prehistoric settlement Sesklo on the hill "Kastra". The first e
xcavations were conducted in 1901-1902 by archaeologist Chr. Tsounta 
while the 1956 RI Theocharis began a new excavation, which lasted 
until 1977. The rare finds and relics surfaced indicating that the 
settlement was inhabited from the 7th millennium BC Back then people 
lived by agriculture and animal husbandry, which testify horn tools, 
blades of obsidian and stone tools found during the excavations. 
The houses were originally made from tree branches and mud, while the 
Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC) the foundations were made of stone and 
floors of  clay. In the Middle Neolithic period (5th millennium BC) 
settlement grows in an area to the west, the houses are larger and form 
small alleys between them and in some places squares. Shortly before the 
end of the fifth millennium settlement ravaged by fire and probably 
inhabited again after 500 years alone more Kastraki hill. 
The archaeological site of Sesklo considered of the greatest Neolithic 
settlements of both Greece and Europe.
