Diminiou

About 5 km. outside Volos is the archaeological site of Diminiou, 
a large and well organized settlement, which was first inhabited in 
the Late Neolithic period (late 5th millennium BC) and had 200 
to 300 people. The archaeological site stands out for its unique 
architecture and is the only settlement that has six stone-built 
enclosures which were constructed in pairs around the settlement. 
The first two designate the central courtyard - square and simultaneously 
served to support the external walls of houses in the main courtyard. 
All the other houses of the village were built within this area. 
This settlement's houses were large and had all shared courtyard. 
These findings are found many stone and bone tools, abundant ceramics 
and figurines and jewelry. 1980 southeast of the hill with the remains

Jason Iolcos. So far they have discovered eight independent private homes 
and the foundations of a large Mycenaean palace overlooking Pagassitikos. 
Also in the area were found and two domed tombs of kings Iolkou. 
The site is open daily except Mondays.
