Church of St. Andrew

It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Church of St. Andrew 
is a pan-Orthodox pilgrimage. The old church was erected between 1836 
and 1843 to the point that martyred Apostle Andrew, was the work of 
Lysander KAFTANTZOGLOU. The new church was founded in 1908 by George 
the First and inaugurated in 1974 by the Bishop of Patras Nicodemus. 
The project began under the supervision of the architect Anastasios 
Metaxas and completed by George Nomikos. It is the largest church in 
the Balkans and one of the largest in Europe. The height of more than 
46 meters and its capacity stands at 5,500. Beside the church survives 
to this day the well of St. Andrews, the area in which they teach and 
in which He was crucified. Is therefore easily understood that beyond 
the religious interest, this temple is of particular historical and 
artistic interest, so I would suggest strongly that your stay in the 
city combined with a visit to him.
