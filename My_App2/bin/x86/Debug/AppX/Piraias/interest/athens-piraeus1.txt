Piraeus port

Piraeus is a historic industrial area and the largest port in the country. 
It is the third most populous city in Greece and is considered one of the
 most important financial centers. We strongly recommend you to visit it 
 as apart from the big market will have the opportunity to enjoy the beauty 
 of the region due to the fact that it is seacoast. Specifically you can 
 visit Microlimano which is currently touring location and belongs to the 
 district of Castella. You'll be able to enjoy a nice walk along the beach 
 and then choose a cafeteria for a drink or restaurants where you can taste 
 some exquisite seafood dishes. The view to the Saronic Gulf is amazing and 
 will surely be rewarded for your choice.
