Syntagma

Square landmark of Athens, Syntagma Square in the heart of the
city in front of the Greek Parliament. The historical importance 
of Syntagma Square is huge for Athens and Greece in general. Until
1843 it was called Palace Square, and in place of the current parliament
were the palaces of King Otto. The current square was named after the
Constitution that gave Otto after a long popular uprising that went
down in history as the "Revolution of 3 September" and spearheaded 
agonist Revolution Makrigianni. The square is bordered by King George
Street in the north, the route Otto south, Filellinon the west and
Amalia Avenue to the east. In the eastern part of Syntagma Square
is the Monument of the Unknown Soldier, a monument representing
a war grave of unidentified soldiers who offered their lives
in the many wars in our history. The main attraction of the
square is the changing of the guard in front of the Monument 
of the Unknown Soldier by the Presidential Guard every hour, with 
synchronized movements of the guards, called evzones. Because of the 
Greek Parliament which is there, Syntagma Square is often a place of
protest with frequent diversions, which makes it inaccessible most of 
the time, especially on weekdays.

trolley, subway (lines 2 and 3) and trams stop here while connected
