Byzantine Church Agia Sofia

This is one of the most important temples of the city built in the 7th 
century in place of a vast Christian basilica which was destroyed by 
an earthquake in 620. He was the cathedral of the city throughout the 
Byzantine period, was converted to Roman Catholicism during the Frankish 
and finally became a mosque from 1523 until 1912. Inside are preserved 
mosaics from the period of iconoclasm which adorn the dome of the sanctuary. 
Also the visitor can admire 11th century frescoes and noticed the sculptural 
decoration that adorns the columns capitals and the pulpit. The church 
nowadays operates on a daily basis and you can visit any time of the day.
