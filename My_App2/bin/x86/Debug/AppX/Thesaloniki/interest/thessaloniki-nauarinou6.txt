Square Navarino

As you descend the arch to the Tsimiskes will encounter the familiar 
Navarino Square. The rumor stems from the fact that this is the most 
eclectic town square except students gathers all types and ages of 
people carrying expressive vitality and an alternative approach in 
this area is a reference point for the city. Town planning perspective, 
this square is located next to the palace of Galerius and near the 
racetrack, two monuments of which a few fragments are preserved after 
the construction activity of the late 50's and 60's destroyed unnecessarily 
large pieces of this ancient heritage. Finally, apart from the delightful 
walk, we suggest you taste the pancakes of the square that have the 
reputation as the best in Thessaloniki.
