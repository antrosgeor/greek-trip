Concert Hall

The creation of the Concert Hall was a work-term for the artistic life 
of the city as missing for decades, and many artistic and other 
activities could be accommodated. The mansion is located on the 
eastern side of the coastal front of the city in the Posidoniou 
funding the construction was covered by national resources and the 
result was really impressive. Responsible for this is a group of 
prominent Greek architects who recently included the famous Japanese 
architect Isozaki APAT who participated in the construction of 
additional new building. If your presence in Thessaloniki combined 
with the staging of a play, it would be a unique opportunity to 
visit this place of art in the context of monitoring a project.
