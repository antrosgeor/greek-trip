Roman Odeon

In the western part of the city is the Roman Odeon of Patras. Erected 
in 170 BC a decade earlier than the construction of Herod Atticus in 
Athens. Indeed, according to Pausanias, the decor and splendor can’t 
match the perfection of the great conservatories in Athens. 
The conservatory was a continuation of the market and within that 
hosted the imposing statue of Apollo. Over the centuries, earthquakes 
and wars conquerors destroyed the building which was buried by soil 
and other materials that left visible only a small part. Rediscovered 
in 1889 but the restoration works started only in 1956. Its capacity 
amounts to 2,300 spectators and nowadays take place here some of the 
greatest theatrical and musical performances. So if you find yourself 
in the city would be a very good option to visit the ancient 
conservatory and have the opportunity to watch an ancient drama 
or a comedy.
