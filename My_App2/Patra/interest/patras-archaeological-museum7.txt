Museum

It is the second largest museum at the national level, the new museum 
of Patra considered a cradle of civilization for the whole Achaia. 
The creation of vision was the former Minister of Culture Melina 
Mercouri but The construction does not begin until 2004. The initial 
aim was to complete the project until 2006 when Patras was Cultural
Capital of Europe but ultimately the inauguration took place on 24 
July 2009. The museum is located in an area of 28 acres, the interiors 
of more than 8,000 square meters and is the typical metal dome its 
greenery and a cultural park that is being set up next to him. The 
construction budget was 21.5 million euros but eventually exceeded 25. 
Divided into four thematic sections, of which three are permanent and 
fourth periodic and hosts various exhibitions throughout the year. The 
main modules are the one that starts from the Mycenaean era and reaches 
to the Roman, the unity of public life and the unity of the necropolis. 
Most archaeologists point out that the establishment of the museum was more 
than necessary when you consider that 70% of the exhibits had been discovered 
in the last 30 years and there was no possibility of exposure. In case 
there is visiting the city of Patra would be great omission not to visit 
the archaeological museum. Besides the style and description of exhibits 
becomes an intelligible and understandable way without getting tired visitors.
