Nautical Museum of Greece

A journey through time with thumbnails ships from all eras.
Outside the museum dominates the top of the submarine Papanikolis. 
Entering the museum see it, a piece of the wall of Piraeus. 
Going to the left you see thumbnails of ships from ancient 
times until today. Biremes, sailboats, ships moved in charcoal, 
copies of warships and submarines, but cruise the Onassis. 
Representations naval, marine navigation systems,
and mirror a real lighthouse.
