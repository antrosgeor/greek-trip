 Rotunda

The building belongs to the greater Rotunda of Galerius complex 
structures including the Arch, the Palace and the Octagon. It 
was built by Galerius around 300 AD in order to become the mausoleum 
and the late 4th century converted into a Christian church. From 1590 
until the liberation of the city (1912) serves as a mosque and after 
the earthquake of 1978 converted into a museum. Domed building is circular 
with a diameter of 24 meters and within the opening 8 large rectangular 
niches. Today, apart from works of art and temporary exhibitions, 
visitors can admire the preserved mosaics and some rare frescoes. 
The Entrance is free and you can visit it throughout the week.
