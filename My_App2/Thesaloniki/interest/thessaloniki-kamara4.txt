of the most iconic landmarks of the city. It is known as Kamara located 
on the north side of the Egnatia highway a short distance from the Rotunda. 
Built in the 4th century AD in honor of the Roman Emperor Galerius who 
victoriously returned to the city after the wars against the Persians. 
Today only two main pillars and a secondary liner and wear as marble 
relief depicting battle scenes. The central arched opening has a width 
of 9.7 meters and a height of 12.5 meters, it passes below the Via Regia 
as it was in Roman Egnatia Street. Indeed by 1953 under the arch were
