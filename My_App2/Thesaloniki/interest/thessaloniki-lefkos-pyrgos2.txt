The most famous symbol of Thessaloniki and one of the most recognizable 
monuments in Greece, the white tower was built as a fortified tower of 
the 15th century and subsequently used as a military camp and prison. 
The last restoration was completed in 1985 and since then the white tower 
used for exhibitions, while from 2006 onwards, operate permanently as 
City Museum of Thessaloniki. The white tower is 34 meters on six floors, 
with an internal staircase that is in contact with the outside wall. 
The tower was not always isolated as it is today, but in the past a wall 
surrounding him that was demolished in 1917 after the liberation
of Thessaloniki (1912).
