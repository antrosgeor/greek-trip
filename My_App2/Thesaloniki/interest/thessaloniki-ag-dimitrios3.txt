St. Demetrius

This is a five-aisled basilica with a transept which is one of the most 
important Byzantine monuments. The exact date of construction of the first 
(early Christian church) is not known but is estimated to have been built 
by the prefect of Illyricum Leontio around 412 AD. But a firestorm led to 
the re-construction of the church between 628 and 634 AD . According to 
tradition, the church was founded by the Roman bath where martyred 
St. Demetrius. Indeed, from this point gushed myrrh which had in many 
therapeutic properties. Over the centuries the church was destroyed by 
several raids and looting and fires left until today indelible marks. 
In 1917 for example, the big fire that hit the 2/3 of city destroyed much 
of the temple which was rebuilt and reopened in 1949. The current form of 
the church resulted from additional work completed in 1958. Also a very 
important date in the history of the church is in 1978 when the relics of 
St. Demetrius returned from the Abbey of St. Lawrence in Campo Italy and 
placed in a silver urn they kept until today. As a guest of the church you 
can admire some of the surviving mosaics and some frescoes dating back to 
the 8th century and reflect the emperors Justinian Cantacuzenus VI and 
Archbishop of Thessaloniki Gregory Palamas. You can also visit the crypt 
of the church, which now serves as an exhibition space for various 
sculptures and other objects of the church.
