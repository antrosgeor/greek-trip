Classic Marathon

The Athens Classic Marathon is an annual race length 42.195 km, which 
usually takes place in early November. In the marathon was introduced
at the first modern Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896. The idea belongs 
to Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the "repetition of 
the famous street of that executed the soldier of Marathon" in 490 BC 
after the Greek victory at the Battle of Marathon to announce the Athenians 
great news and he died soon after. This myth has given the peaceful 
symbolism in Marathon, becoming increasingly popular sport in recent 
decades and has now established the so-called "Tourism Marathon", with 
thousands of cities to host marathons around the world. The route of 
the marathon in Athens is considered the most historic, but also one 
of the toughest in the world because of the ascent that show. The start 
is from the village of Marathon and ending at the Panathenaic Stadium. 
During the days of Marathon, held several parallel events include 
conferences and symposia, and very impressive is the opening ceremony, 
the lighting of the Flame of the Marathon. In the city of Marathon is a 
museum dedicated to marathon runners, a permanent exhibition showing 
the history of the Olympic Marathon through texts, objects and pictures
