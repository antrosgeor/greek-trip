Acropolis

As Athens Acropolis means the rock on which were built the Parthenon,
the Temple of Athena Nike and the Propylaea, the Erechtheum and other
smaller buildings. The rock used as a natural shelter, storage and 
administrative space in case of a siege of Athens and had early 
buildings of stone and wood, until Pericles decided to build the 
buildings that remain today. 
The architects Iktinos Kallikratis and the sculptor Phidias were the 
designers responsible for the execution of the Parthenon. The works of
the Parthenon began in 447pCh and continued until 432pCh. Other buildings 
completed until 406pCh while there were other additions to the cluster, 
the most significant of the theater of Herod Atticus, the 161mCh. 
Pericles used the money of the Delian League, which caused great 
reactions inside and outside the Athens of Pericles' rivals, who accused 
him of squandering of public money embezzlement foreign money at a time 
when Athens was moving headlong toward war with Sparta. 
Later, the Parthenon was used as a temple, mosque and gunpowder during 
the Byzantine period and the Turkish occupation. 
The buildings were bombed, rocked by earthquakes and robbed by Byzantines, 
Turks and British over the centuries.
Nevertheless, the Parthenon is still awe inspiring and is one of 
the wonders of the ancient world.
